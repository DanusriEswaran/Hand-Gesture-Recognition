# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
--model_for_gesture.py:
  Loads pre-trained model for gesture recognition.
  Maps gestures to specific actions for execution.
--DataFlair_TrainCNN.py:
  Likely trains a CNN model for gesture recognition.
--create_gesture_data.py:
  Captures webcam images to create a dataset for gesture recognition.

Project Description:
The project involves creating a hand gesture recognition system. The model_for_gesture.py script loads a pre-trained model to recognize gestures and execute corresponding actions. DataFlair_TrainCNN.py is likely used for training a CNN model to improve gesture recognition. create_gesture_data.py aids in collecting webcam images to build a dataset for training the recognition models. Overall, these scripts contribute to developing a system for hand gesture recognition with potential applications in human-computer interaction.
